# Obsidian Pinboard Sync

An Obsidian plugin that adds links you've saved with [Pinboard](http://Pinboard.in) to your Obsidian Daily Notes, synchronizing periodically.

## Why?

I've been using Pinboard to store links to interesting websites from the web for years, and from iOS devices with the help of the wonderful app [Pinner](http://pinnerapp.net).  I would like Obsidian to store these links as part of my Daily Notes to remind me to refer back to them, and also so that I can add some notes about each site.

## Disclaimer 🚨

The initial sync will backfill your recent posts from Pinboard into Obsidian. This potentially means creating/modifying up to a hundred files. I recommend testing this plugin out in a new vault first to make sure you're happy with the result.  You may not want Daily Notes with Pinboard links going that far back in time.

## Usage

This plugin will fetches recent links posted to your Pinboard and dumps them into the Daily Note corresponding to the date the link was stored.

It also displays any tags associated to the links.

It will refetch the posts at a designated interval.

## Settings

| Setting | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| Token | API token from your Pinboard account. Available in [settings/password](https://pinboard.in/settings/password) |
| Tag Prefix | Prefix added to Pinboard tags when imported into Obsidian (e.g. #pinboard/work) |
| Use new line as separator | Use a new line (instead of a space) to separate URL, description and tags |
| Enable adding pins to daily notes | When enabled, pins will be synced to the day's daily note |
| Section Heading | Markdown heading to use when adding the Pinboard links to a daily note |
| Enable periodic syncing | Toggle to enable/disable automatic syncing |
| Sync Frequency | Number of seconds to wait between syncs |
| Recent Posts | Number of recent posts to use when syncing (up to 100) |
| Enable one note per pin mode | When enabled, syncing will create a new note per pin |
| One note per pin path | The path to store pins in when using the one note per pin setting |
| One note per pin tag | An optional tag to add to all notes created to match pinboard pins |
| One note per pin title format | The format to use when saving pins into the folder. Uses moment format, supports fields like [{description}], [{href}], [{extended}], [{shared}], [{toread}], [{tags}] |

## Limitations

This plugin currently only syncs the last xx posts, where xx <100.  Why?  I just switched over to using Obsidian from Roam, and I didn't want 1000 of Daily Notes that were only old Pinboard links.

This doesn't currently support "Pinboard Notes" because I never used those.
